# Exam 3 Instructions

Follow these CAREFULLY to ensure full credit

Exam 3 has no subdirectories

BUT Exam 3 does have a few things to complete: 1 file with questions (answers.md) and 2 files requiring you to create new code files (inheritance.js and chaining.js)

## Exam rules

### 3rd Parties

You can and should discuss and inspire one another, including about material covered by the exam.  Your exam work, however, should be purely your work.  If someone has a particular function, for example, don't just paste it in.  Changing the names of the variables is not very effective.  Instead, understand how their version works, and create your own version using your understanding.

Do not use any external sources, including but not limited to JS libraries such as lodash, underscore, jquery, babel, browserify, and webpack.

### Due

The pull request and matching branch should be in github by 11:59pm Mon Apr 23

### Format

Your code should be in this directory, using the filenames indicated below.  You should not create additional directories nor create additional files beyond those.

Your Pull Request should request to merge your "exam3" branch with master on your assignment repo.

The branch should include only the files needed (e.g. no node_modules, no IDE files)

Your files need to be accessible and human-legible (It shouldn't be in some dense format or weird filetype)

### Best Practices

Follow the best practices discussed in class

For this exam, pay particular attention to:
- Fulfill the spirit of the question!  If in doubt, ask.
-   Consistent indenting
- Following the JS idioms demonstrated so far (don't write code as if this were a different programming language)
- Clean Pull Requests and repos (seriously - no unneeded files)

### Worst Practices (for this exam) 

Definitely do NOT do these:
- Include unnecessary and/or confusing files in the pull request
- Answer vaguely
- Write code that technically works, but doesn't show the answer the question was trying to get

## Expected file structure:
* exam03/README.md
* exam03/answers.md
* exam03/inheritance.js
* exam03/constructor.js
* exam03/es6class.js
* exam03/basis.js
* exam03/brute.js
* exam03/chaining.js
* exam03/chain.js

## Question Task

Answer the questions in `answers.md` using markdown format, filling in the indicated answer spots.  Make sure your answers are clear and complete.  In particular, be careful that your nouns and pronouns will not be confused (will I know what 'it' is when you say 'it does' something?) and that you have addressed all parts of the question.  Answers that technically answer the question but do not answer the spirit of the question do not count.

Answers are expected to be a paragraph, but take as much or as little space to answer the question as needed.

## Code Task

Create the files `constructor.js`, `es6class.js`, `basis.js`, and `brute.js` so that `node inheritance.js` runs as indicated in that file

Create the file `chain.js` so that the `node chaining.js` runs as indicated in that file`
