# Exam 2, part 1

## Expected file structure:
* exam02/part01/README.md
* exam02/part01/answers.md

## Task

Answer the questions in `answers.md` using markdown format, filling in the indicated answer spots.  Make sure your answers are clear and complete.  In particular, be careful that your nouns and pronouns will not be confused (will I know what 'it' is when you say 'it does' something?) and that you have addressed all parts of the question.

Answers are expected to be a paragraph, but take as much or as little space to answer the question as needed.
